# Include all projects.  All apps in all projects will generate an
# ApplicationSet that will only generate Applications for matching
# <cluster_name> + <tenant> + <app_name> combinations.
#
# An ApplicationSet that doesn't match anything will still be configured
# in ArgoCD but won't generate any Application objects & thus not deploy
# the application anywhere.
